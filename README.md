I developed a load balancer using Flask and SocketIO, implementing health checks and dynamic server selection to ensure reliable distribution of client requests to healthy backend servers. The project featured a round-robin algorithm for request routing, with plans to extend support for least connections and IP hash algorithms. Additionally, I handled real-time operations using WebSocket communication, enabling efficient processing of client operations and seamless delivery of results.
